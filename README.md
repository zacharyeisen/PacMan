1. PACMEN EXERCISE
2. This is a simple game where you have two buttons on the browser page. One button creates a pacman image, and the other button starts moving the Pacman across the screen.

How to run: all you need to do to run this program is follow this link:

1. Roadmap of future improvements: This particular program isn't quite complete in its current state. I will complete it so the pacmen populate on the screen. eventually, I'd like to add a background similar to the original game.
